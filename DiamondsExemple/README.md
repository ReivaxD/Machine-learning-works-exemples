**The dataset that we will be considering is [Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds), which contains several characteristics of a series of diamonds, such as their dimensions, the quality of their cuts, their prices, etc. The goal of this exemple is to show how i interpret dataset to get the best model. Datasets nowadays could have a lot of variable and models need to select best predictors to avoid overfitting.**

**Dataset's column information:**

- `price`: price in US dollars.
- `carat`: weight of the diamond. 
- `cut`: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- `color`: diamond's color, from J (worst) to D (best).
- `clarity`: how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- `x`: length in mm.
- `y`: width in mm. 
- `z`: height in mm.
- `table`: width of top of the diamond relative to its widest point. 
- `depth` = (2z) / (x+y).
