**The dataset that we will be considering is [Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds), which contains several characteristics of a series of diamonds, such as their dimensions, the quality of their cuts, their prices, etc. The goal of the lab will be to define linear regression models to best estimate diamond prices using a bunch of predictor variables, and to understand the meaning of the obtained coefficients.**

**Dataset's column information:**

- `price`: price in US dollars.
- `carat`: weight of the diamond. 
- `cut`: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- `color`: diamond's color, from J (worst) to D (best).
- `clarity`: how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
- `x`: length in mm.
- `y`: width in mm. 
- `z`: height in mm.
- `table`: width of top of the diamond relative to its widest point. 
- `depth` = (2z) / (x+y).
