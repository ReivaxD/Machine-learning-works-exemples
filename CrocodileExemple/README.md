**The dataset that we will be considering is [Global Crocodile Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zadafiyabhrami/global-crocodile-species-dataset), which contains several characteristics of a series of crocodiles, such as their commom name, their scientific name, their family, etc. The purpose of this exemple is to create a classification algorithm to identify a crocodile's common or scientific names**

**Dataset's column information:**

- `Common Name`: The common name of a crocodile.
- `Scientific Name`: The scientific name of a crocodile.
- `Family`: The family (unique = "Crocodylidae")
