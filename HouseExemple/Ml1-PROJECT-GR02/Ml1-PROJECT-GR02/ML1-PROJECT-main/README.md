# Machine Learning 1 Project

### Authors

- Estebane Vanduynslager
- Xavier Delabie
- Alan Altruy

### Description

This project entails a Kaggle competition to develop the most accurate regression model for predicting house lot area. Teams will train models using a dataset containing both continuous and categorical predictors. Following model development, teams will submit their predictions to the competition, along with a detailed report and an oral presentation.

### TODO List
- [X] Cleaning Data (?necessary?)
- [X] Reorganise code
- [X] Check Random Forests + implemented
- [X] Choose the best features (dynamic) (maybe not)
- [X] Plots representing the data correctly
- [X] Do the same for second model
